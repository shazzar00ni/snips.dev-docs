# Alpha User Testing Plan

---

## Objective
Validate Snips.dev’s core capture → search → share workflow and willingness to pay for Pro features.

## Key Hypotheses
1. **H1:** ≥90% of participants can capture, search, and share a snippet in under 30 seconds.
2. **H2:** ≥20% of participants express intent to upgrade to Pro at $8/month.

## Participants & Recruitment Screener
**Target:** Professional developers with 2+ years experience, who regularly share code or screenshots.

### Screener Questions (online form)
1. What is your current role? (Developer, Designer, Student, Other)
2. How many years have you worked in software development? (>2 required)
3. How often do you share code snippets/screenshots? (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Never)
4. Which tools do you currently use to share code snippets? (GitHub Gist, CodePen, Imgur, None)
5. Are you willing to participate in a 30-minute remote usability session and receive a $50 gift card? (Yes/No)

## Session Logistics
- Format: Remote, moderated via Zoom
- Duration: 30 minutes each
- Sample Size: 8–12 participants
- Incentive: $50 gift card

## Moderator Script
### Introduction (5 mins)
- Welcome & thank participant
- Explain purpose: test early Snips.dev prototype
- Confidentiality & consent
